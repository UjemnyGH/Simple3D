# Simple 3D

Simple 3D library

This library is still in development and current state may change as at this moment code needs some upgrades

This library contain only ONE file "simple3d.hpp" with OpenGL - GLAD loader in it, but you still needs to download GLFW as it is used for window

Still, have fun playing with it - Piotr UjemnyGH Plombon
